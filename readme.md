# Golland_TimesheetBot
This tool sends automated email reminders to staff for them to fill out their timesheets. It was inspired by messages received from our Chief of Staff to help expedite payroll processing of the HR team who were often frustrated by our forgetfulness.   

This improves the manual reminders for timesheet completion and replaces the weird copy pasted clock gifs with NewYorker caption contest image to give employees something funny, unique and memorable every two weeks this task is required.
